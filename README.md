# NgJestCucumber

A very simple Angular 8 project to demonstrate the ability to test component logic using Jest and Cucumber.

The app contains a shopping-list component where you can add items to the shopping list and the total price is then calculated.

I have then added tests written in cucumber, and executed in jest to test this functionality:

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via Jest.

## Further help
